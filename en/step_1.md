## Introduction:
In this project, children are introduced to CSS classes. They use multiple CSS classes to style text and also learn how to use background images and free Google fonts in their projects. 


## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinket:

+ ['Mystery Letter' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-letter](http://jumpto.cc/web-letter)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Mystery Letter Finished' -- trinket.io/html/1d4d4c5ce1](https://trinket.io/html/1d4d4c5ce1)

## Learning Objectives

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)
+ Understand the skills which are developed towards a career involving Computing

## Challenges
