## Introduction:
In this project, children are introduced to CSS classes. They use multiple CSS classes to style text and also learn how to use background images and free Google fonts in their projects. 


## Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinket:

+ ['Mystery Letter' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-letter](http://jumpto.cc/web-letter)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Mystery Letter Finished' -- trinket.io/html/1d4d4c5ce1](https://trinket.io/html/1d4d4c5ce1)

This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ mystery-letter/index.html
+ mystery-letter/style.css
+ mystery-letter/script.js
+ mystery-letter/prefixfree.js
