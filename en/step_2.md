## Choose Your Message

Mystery letters are used in films and books to send secret messages. 



+ Think of a mystery message; 12 words is about the right length. If you can't think of a message you can use the example: 'Your next clue is in the safe. The code is 65536.'

+ Either make a note of your message or remember it.
