## Editing Your Message

Let's get your message onto a webpage.



+ Open this trinket: <a href="http://jumpto.cc/web-letter" target="_blank">jumpto.cc/web-letter</a>. 

	The project should look like this:

+ The `<p>` paragraph tag is introduced in the 'Happy Birthday' project. The `<span>` tag is used to group smaller pieces of text inside a paragraph so that we can style them.

+ Change the words to your message by putting one word in each `<span>`. You will need to add or remove `<span>` tags if your message is a different length.

+ Click the Run button to test your trinket.

	If you look at the words, you can see that they’ve been styled to look like they’ve been stuck onto the page.
