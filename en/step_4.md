## Using Class Styles



+ Did you notice the `class=""` in the `<span>` tags? You can use this to style more than one thing in the same way. 

+ Add the `magazine1` class to a few of your `<span>` tags and test your webpage.

+ You can add more than one class to an element. Just leave a space in between. Add the `big` class to one of your `<span>` tags. Test your page.
