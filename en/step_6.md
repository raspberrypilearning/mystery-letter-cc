## Editing Classes 



+ Click on the __'style.css'__ tab. Find the style for the `newspaper` CSS class that you have been using.

+ Notice that there's a dot (full stop) '.' before the name of the class in the CSS file but not in the `<span>` tag in your HTML document.

+ Now look at the other CSS classes that you used to style your mystery letter. Can you find:

	+ How the `magazine1` style changes the text to all uppercase (capital) letters.

	+ How the `magazine2` style puts an image behind the text.

+ What happens if you change the `background-image` for `magazine2` to `canvas.png`? If you prefer `pink-pattern.png` you can change it back. 

You can also change the colours in the magazine styles if you like.

+ Find the CSS used to rotate and skew (tilt) your words:

Try changing the numbers to create different effects and then testing your page.
